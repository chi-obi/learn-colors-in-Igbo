Project focuses on understanding what CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is and how it is essential for styling web pages. Lays the groundwork to grasp how CSS enhances the visual presentation of websites, moving beyond the limitations of HTML.

Key Concepts Learned:
1. Definition of CSS: CSS is a style sheet language that specifies how elements on a web page should look, allowing developers like myself to create visually appealing designs.
2. Cascading Effect: Highlights the concept of cascading in CSS, where styles are applied from general to specific, similar to a waterfall, which is fundamental for understanding how CSS rules interact with each other.
3. Types of Styles: Introduction to inline, internal, and external styles, offering a comprehensive view of how to apply CSS in different contexts.

Tools and Projects:
This hands-on project involves creating a simple web page where the CSS concepts learnt are applied, using styles to modify layout, colors, fonts, and overall aesthetics. This practical application helps reinforce understanding and ability to manipulate styles effectively.

Project Goal:
The main goal of the project is to practice applying CSS in a real-world scenario, allowing internalization of the syntax and properties of the language, leading to a visually coherent web page.

Learning Outcomes:
- Understand and explain the purpose of CSS and its cascading nature.
- Differentiate between various ways to implement CSS in web projects.
- Utilize CSS effectively to style HTML elements and enhance the user interface of a website.
